                <p>
                    Our 8-Months curriculum is designed to get you hired. Classes are interactive and have a rigorous
                     structure. Real Software Products are taken as a project with a team of 3-5 students. At New Horizons,
                      students learn by building. While the linear progression of our curriculum is focused on building 
                      technical skills, our aim is to teach students how to become software engineers—which is distinct 
                      from simply knowing how to code. Students engage in a number of activities that will improve their
                       communication and collaboration skills and immerse themselves in the technical community, helping 
                       build the foundation needed to grow as software engineers in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dive into the software development environment and the basics of computing, networks, and data
                     structures. Discover the skills to build applications that meet user needs, model data, develop
                      wireframes, and work collaboratively through version control.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Learn to build applications from the ground up using key programming languages and frameworks. Apply essential object-oriented programming concepts, write high-quality JavaScript, and leverage JS libraries like React to build a dynamic front-end. Incorporate functionality from third-party APIs and add complexity and nuance with Python, Django, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the conclusion of each program module, students build advanced Portfolio Projects to demonstrate
                     both the technical skills they’ve gained in the module and their creativity which become MVPs for
                      startups, and will be presented to different Tech-Startups Investors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our Students will push every line of code they write to GitHub giving them an extensive profile to show
                     employers and fellow engineers. Also we expose our students to OEM’s like IBM, Microsoft, Google, 
                     technical Meetups and conferences.
                </p>
